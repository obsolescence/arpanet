# PDP-10/ITS Host Configuration
# This file specifies which IMP host interfaces should have "set convert" mode enabled.
# Format: imp <number>, host <index>
#
# Where:
#   - imp number: IMP number (e.g., 6, 62)
#   - host index: 0 for HI1, 1 for HI2, etc.
#
# The "convert" mode should ONLY be used for PDP-10/ITS/TENEX connections,
# NEVER for ncpd or other host types.
#
# Lines starting with '#' are comments and will be ignored.

# IMP 62, HI2 - HILTON-KA1 (PDP-10/ITS)
 imp 62, host 1
 imp 6, host 0
 imp 6, host 1
