	<br>	JOT COMPUTATION IS ONE-TO-ONE LETTER MATCHING
	<br>	WOULD YOU LIKE TO GO FIRST?
	<br>	JOTTO is a word game played by two players: yourself and the program. 
	<br>	Each player thinks up one five letter secret word. 
	<br>	The object of the game is to guess your opponent's
	<br>	secret word by deducing which letters it contains. 
	<br>	You do this by presenting your opponent with a five letter test word.
	<br>	Your opponent then tells you how many of the letters in that word 
	<br>	match the letters in his secret word. 
	<br>	The message about one-to-one letter matching means that if your test word
	<br>	was "SISSY" and the program's secret word was "TEARS", 
	<br>	the number of matching letters or "JOTS" would be one.
	<br>	The same is true if the test word was "TEARS" and the secret word
	<br>	was "SISSY". You and your opponent alternately give each other test words 
	<br>	and number of "jots" until one of you guesses the other's secret word.

	<br>	<blockquote><i>Note: Carriage returns (fCR1; are not required
	<br>	to terminate your input. The system automatically

	<br>
	<br>

	<br>3. To invoke the MUDDLE interpreter:
	<br>	
	<br>	<u>:muddle</u> [CR]
	<br>	
	<br>	MUDDLE 56 IN OPERATION.
	<br>	LISTENING-AT-LEVEL 1 PROCESS 1
	<br>	
	<br>	The canonical first step in learning a language like MUDDLE is to define the function
	<br>	FACTORIAL, rescursively. MUDDLE type-in is terminated by typing ESCAPE (ALTMODE). The
	<br>	following multi-line function definition is a single MUDDLE transaction which we have 
	<br>	broken into lines for explanatory purposes, <i>and so that you can copy-paste the lines
	<br>	into the terminal window.</i> Note carefully the use of <b>upper case</b> (MUDDLE dis-
	<br>	tinguishes upper and lower case) and the delimiting spaces in MUDDLE type-in, which we 
	<br>	have not emphasized in our usual bold way:
	<br>	
	<br>	<u>&lt;DEFINE FACT (N)</u>
	<br>	[CR]
	<br>	
	<br>	Define FACT to be a function of one variable, named "N" inside of FACT. In typing its
	<br>	definition (to follow), use DEL or RUBOUT to delete an incorrectly typed character and
	<br>	control-L ("tL") to get the current input buffer typed out. Try control-L.
	<br>	
	<br>	<u>&lt;COND</u>
	<br>	[CR]
	<br>	
	<br>	FACT is a simple CONDitional with the following clauses.
	<br>	
	<br>	<u>(&lt;0? .N&gt;1)</u>
	<br>	[CR]
	<br>	
	<br>	If the argument to FACT is zero (0?) , then FACT returns the value 1, as expected.
	<br>	
	<br>	<u>(ELSE &lt;* .N &ltFACT &lt- .N 1&gt;&gt;&gt;) &gt;&gt;</u>
	<br>	[ESC]
	<br>	
	<br>	If the argument to FACT is not equal to zero (ELSE), then FACT returns the product (*) of
	<br>	the value of N and the value of FACT applied to N minus 1. Here we balance the brackets
	<br>	for the product (given in prefix notation as is MUDDLE's normal mode), balance the paren
	<br>	thesis of the second conditional (ELSE) clause, and balance the brackets for the COND and
	<br>	DEFINE, respectively. With the function definition complete, we type ESCAPE to get MUDDLE
	<br>	to process it.
	<br>	
	<br>	FACT
	<br>	
	<br>	Having evaluated our definition of FACT and entered it in its memory, MUDDLE returns the
	<br>	function name FACT
	<br>	
	<br>	<u>&lt;FACT 5&gt;</u>
	<br>	[ESC]
	<br>	
	<br>	Try FACT out on a few small numbers whose FACTORIAL you know; like 5 for example, whose
	<br>	FACTORIAL is 120 (5xAx3x2xlxl).
	<br>	
	<br>	120
	<br>	
	<br>	MUDDLE performs the specified evaluation and returns the correct value.
	<br>	
	<br>	<u>&lt;FACT 13&gt;</u>
	<br>	[ESC]
	<br>	
	<br>	Try FACT for 13 now; a more challenging computation.
	<br>	6227020800
	<br>	MUDDLE returns the correct answer, as you can verify with pencil and paper 
	<br>	in a few long minutes.
	<br>	
	<br>	<u>&lt;FACT 14&gt;</u>
	<br>	[ESC]
	<br>	
	<br>	Now try 14, a slightly larger number for FACT.
	<br>	*ERR0R*
	<br>	OVERFLOW
	<br>	*
	<br>	LISTENING-AT-LEVEL 2 PROCESS 1
	<br>	
	<br>	MUDDLE encounters a number too large to represent as an integer in the PDP-10. The
	<br>	overflow condition, detected during an invocation of the function "*" (multiply), signals
	<br>	an error condition. Because we have made no provision for this condition ourselves, it is
	<br>	passed untrapped up to the user, you.
	<br>	
	<br>	<u>&lt;ARGS &lt;FRAME &lt;FRAME&gt;&gt;&gt;</u>
	<br>	[ESC]
	<br>	
	<br>	The environment in which the error occurred remains for user perusal at this higher ERROR
	<br>	level. You examine the arguments to the function "*" (multiply) which caused it to over
	<br>	flow. The arguments are found in a push-down-stack frame.
	<br>	[14 6227020800]
	<br>	It must be that 14 times 6227020800 is too large an integer for the PDP-10 to represent.
	<br>	
	<br>	<u>&lt;ERRET&gt;</u>
	<br>	[ESC]
	<br>	
	<br>	Understanding the difficulty, you do an error return (ERRET) to back out to the top level,
	<br>	to try something new. The error environment, having supplied you with what you needed to
	<br>	know, is now discarded.
	<br>	LISTENING-AT-LEVEL 1 PROCESS 1
	<br>	
	<br>	<u>&lt;FACT 33.0&gt;</u>
	<br>	[ESC]
	<br>	
	<br>	Try FACT with a floating point number.
	<br>	.86833170E37
	<br>	That seems to work with the precision of a 36-bit word floating point number 
	<br>	(7.2 decimal digits).
	<br>	
	<br>	<u>&lt;FACT 34.0&gt;</u>
	<br>	[ESC]
	<br>	
	<br>	•ERROR*
	<br>	OVERFLOW
	<br>	•
	<br>	LISTENING-AT-LEVEL 2 PROCESS 1
	<br>	
	<br>	<u>&lt;ARGS &lt;FRAME &lt;FRAME&gt;&gt;&gt;</u>
	<br>	[ESC]
	<br>	
	<br>	Again we have overflow in the function (multiply). Again we look at the offending
	<br>	arguments on the preserved runtime stack.
	<br>	[34.000000 .86833170E37]
	<br>	
	<br>	<u>&lt;ERRET&gt;</u>
	<br>	[ESC]
	<br>	
	<br>	We now know the limits of our simple recursive definition of FACTORIAL using single preci
	<br>	sion PDP-10 arithmetic. Return to MUDDLE's top level by doing an error return (ERRET).

	<br>	4. To send mail to another DMCG ITS user, type:
	<br>	
	<br>	<u>:mail</u> [SP] <u>ausr</u> [SP] <u>hello</u> [CR]
	 
	<br>	<blockquote><i>Note that in the example, the mail is being
	<br>	sent to user "ausr". Because AUSR has
	<br>	no file directory at DMCG, his mail is put in
	<br>	a common file directory (COM).
	<br>	This method of sending mail allows one-line
	<br>	messages only.</i></blockquote>

	<br>	5. To read a user's mail, type:
	<br>	<u>:mail</u> [SP] <u>iccakb</u> [CR]
	<br>	
	<br>	You are requesting that all of a user's pending
	<br>	mail be typed on your console. This collection
	<br>	of mail will also be typed out when the user in
	<br>	question logs in next time. You might try
	<br>	sending mail to yourself, as above, to get mail
	<br>	the next time you log into DMCG ITS during the
	<br>	ICCC convention.
	<br>

	<br>	6. To use the DMCG ITS ARPANET NETWRK subsystem, type:
	<br>	; netwrk I CR 1 •
	
	<br>	<blockquote><i>NETWRK sources are there, not the program?</i></blockquote>
	
	<br>	The rest of this text is Work In Progress - please ignore for now
	<br><br><br>
	<br>	\NETWRK.202\
	<br>	\; TYPE "? CR " FOR HELP.\ Backslash ("\") is the NETWRK prompt and escape
	<br>	character. Type it anytime to return to the
	<br>	• NETWRK command interpreter.
	<br>	1. To get help from the NETWRK subsystem, type:
	<br>	\? GOD
	<br>	TYPE "HELP CR" FOR ADDITIONAL INSTRUCTIONS.
	<br>	IMPORTANT COMMANDS:
	<br>	? ?? HELP SURVEY REAL.TIME.SURVEY STATUS CONNECTION. TO DISCONNECT
	<br>	QUIT LOGOUT RESET SOCKET.MAP HISTORY.OF SUMMARY.OF.SURVEYS ACTIVE.HOSTS
	<br>	BEST.SURVEY CURRENT LONGTERM TIME COMMANDS
	<br>	DMCG has a SURVEY subsystem which performs a periodic survey of ARPANET serving HOSTs to
	<br>	develop statistics on their availability. A SURVEY is taken automatically every 15 minutes
	<br>	and the results kept in a file for later study. The NETWRK subsystem allows on-line access
	<br>	to the SURVEY data base on serving HOST availability. Note that the SURVEY program runs
	<br>	every 15 minutes, 24 hours a day, when the DMCG ITS time-sharing system is in operation.
	<br>	8. To print the results of the last survey taken:
	<br>	\sur fSPl VEY
	<br>	SURVEY TAKEN AT 18:03:39 on 09/19/72
	<br>	—HOST— -#- STATUS
	<br>	UCLA-NMC 001 LOGGER AVAILABLE,
	<br>	SRI-ARC 002 LOGGER AVAILABLE,
	<br>	UCSB-75 003 LOGGER AVAILABLE
	<br>	UTAH-10 004 LOGGER AVAILABLE
	<br>	The list continues. The HOST numbers are given in
	<br>	octal (sorry). The various conditions reported describe
	<br>	the state of the HOST hardware, ARPANET Network Control
	<br>	Program, and TELNET server (LOGGER), all of which must
	<br>	be functioning to some minimum extent for "Logger available"
	<br>	to be reported.
	<br>	9. To get a brief summary of the SURVEYS for about the last 24 hours, type:
	<br>	\sum [13 MARY.OF.SURVEYS
	<br>	00072 SURVEYS FROM 00:16:35 on 09/19/72 to 18.:03:19 on 09/19/72
	<br>	—HOST— -#- -%-UP- -RESP-
UCLA-NMC 001 097% 00.80
SRI-ARC 002 068% 01.23
UCSB-75 003 059% 00.63
The per cent gives the fraction of surveys which resulted
in a "Logger available" condition for the specified serving
HOST. The "resp" gives the mean number of seconds (for
successful connection attempts) from the first probe to the
first response for the specified HOST.
4
10. To get a summary of SURVEY statistics for the "long term", type:
\lon HEI GTERM sum [SP] MARY.OF.SURVEYS
10848 SURVEYS FROM 19:48:24 on 04/27/72 to 00:01: 3 on 09/19/72
-HOST— -#- -%-UP- -RESP-
UCLA-NMC 001 071% 01.00
SRI-ARC 002 058% 02.53
UCSB-75 003 053% 00.80
UTAH-10 004 062% 02.33
The Hat continues giving summary data for over 10,000
SURVEYS for about the last 6 months. Please note that
this data does not account for scheduled down time, nor
does it account for time that the specified HOST was up
but not available to the ARPANET.
11. To get a history for a specific serving HOST, type:
\lon fSP] GTERM his. HE TORY.OF nic fcT)
You can ask for a history for any of the serving HOSTs by
name (see HELP) or by number (use octal or decimal preceded
by period). Note that the "response time" measure given
relates to the mean time (on successful connections) from
the first probe to the first response, only.
FIRST SURVEY AT 19:48:24 on 04/27/72
UNDETERMINED 00000 TIMES (000%)
HOST DISCONNECTED 03474 TIMES (032%)
NCP NOT RESPONDING 00000 TIMES (000%)
LOGGER NOT RESPONDING 01016 TIMES (009%)
LOGGER REJECTING 00000 TIMES (000%)
LOGGER AVAILABLE 06358 TIMES (058%)
AVERAGE RESPONSE TIME = 02.53
LAST SURVEY AT 00:01:34 ON 09/19/72 \
12. To exit from the NETWRK subsystem, type:
\ quit fCRl
KILL
	<br>	
	<br>	
	<br>	13. To logout of the DMCG system:
	<br>	; logout ICR 1
	<br>	ITS 761 CONSOLE 31 FREE
	<br>	14. To disconnect from DMCG ITS, type:
	<br>	|C HE
	<br>	T R CLOSED

<!--    1972 was a confusing time. The TIP now speaks to you in decimal numbers, but once logged in on these big machines, they prefer to speak in octal to you. 6 Decimal is 6 octal, but 70 becomes 106 and 126 becomes 176. Just so you are aware of how they present their host numbers to you.
